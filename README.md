# Meta Files Lookup
 repository that was created in idea to assign files (eg.: pictures, documents) a META tags, store them, and also be able to search all files that contain a desired tag(s)

General idea is that if you have some files (eg.: in Archeology/Reenactment/...) you may need to have several pictures, documents, ... that you want to store and be able to find quickly. The purpose of this software is to assign META tags (tags will be named as you decide) to those files and need not to be duplicated in more categories on your drive, therefore helps to save space.

#### Option 1
Imagine that you are a reenactor. You have your costume that consists of many assets. These assets, each have their own unique name, type of asset, material, possibly location where archeological evidence was found about it, ...
Now imagine, that you are not only storing information about yourself, but also your whole reenactment community.
That would be kinda difficult process to manage and track without a helper like this.

#### Option 2
Imagine you are an archaelogist. You have images, documents that show archaeological evidence about carolingian jewelry. But it contains also some evidence about jewelry from Great Moravia or Phrysia. You would need to remember where you put that file or duplicate it into several categories. Now you have the option to assign eg.: "jewelry", "carolingian", "merovingian", "Great Moravia", "Phrysia", "9th century", ... And if you then search for "Great Moravia" it would return you all the documents, images, PDFs, ... that have been assigned that META-TAG. It's also possible to combine the search with more tags for example "Hat", "Silk", "Reenactor:NameOfHistoricCompany:Juraj"
